Timeout in the Wasteland
========================

*Survival in Unfortunate Times*


What Is It?
-----------

Timeout in the Wasteland is an interactive fiction game that can be played
online or downloaded via the `Timeout in the Wasteland itch.io page`_. It
was released as part of the `NarraScope 2020 Game Jam`_. 

What Is It About?
-----------------

Take on the role of an unlikely survivor who's both trying to navigate a new
world and decide what that all even means. It takes place at a key point in
time, so you've got only five days to achieve your goals while keeping things
from falling apart. After those five days you'll either have won or lost.

Warning!
--------

Be aware that one play tester said of this game "it's quite stressful in a
way that's unusual in IF". It's horror. It's fairly subtle horror, but it's
still horror. All that being said, I hope you enjoy it.

Also, note that on the Interactive Fiction Cruelty Scale this is arguably
Tough or even Nasty, but it provides enough clues to enable the careful
player to avoid unfixable situations. It's also short enough to make it
practical to play it through from the beginning multiple times in order to
get things just right.

Status
------

This game is fully playable and winnable and should hopefully be reasonably
bug-free (please let me know if you find any issues and I'll add your name
to the play testers credits when I fix them).
